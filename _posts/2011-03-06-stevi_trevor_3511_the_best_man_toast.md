  Good evening,
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  You&#8217;ll have to forgive me if I seem a<br /> bit nervous, I&#8217;m not used to being in a room where there are more<br /> people than computers.

  Since this is a wedding and all, I<br /> decided that we should toast to love. By show of hands, how many of<br /> you believe in love? What is love? You can&#8217;t see it, touch it, or<br /> hear it. It doesn&#8217;t grow on a tree. Stevi is not going to call Trevor<br /> at work one day and say &#8220;Hey Hun, we are almost out of love, can<br /> you stop at the store and pick up a jar on your way home?&#8221;

  Love is a hard thing to understand, and<br /> an even harder thing to try and describe. Even though you can&#8217;t touch<br /> love, you can feel it. And even though you can&#8217;t see love, you can<br /> see it&#8217;s effect. Love is a simple smile, or a much needed hug. Love<br /> is a little note, or a few flowers. Love is a state of mind, a<br /> decision, and a choice.
</p>

  Love is a proud young father, grinning<br /> from big ear, to big ear, as he carries around his newborn son. Love<br /> is a taco bell sauce packet, shipped across the country, and then<br /> saved for over a year because of it&#8217;s special message. When your<br /> groom says &#8220;Why not?&#8221; when asked why he&#8217;s marrying you, love is<br /> knowing that he was trying to say &#8220;Why wouldn&#8217;t I?&#8221; Love is a big<br /> brother, trying to say something useful, and something meaningful,<br /> without sounding like a big sister.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  Love is patient, love is kind. It does<br /> not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is<br /> not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of<br /> wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It<br /> always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love<br /> never fails.

  Trevor, I still remember vividly the<br /> first time you called me &#8220;Travis&#8221; instead of &#8220;Bruher&#8221;. Even<br /> though I practically forced you, it took me a long time to get used<br /> to it. I&#8217;ve learned since that moment that our relationship would be<br /> forever evolving. Over the years I&#8217;ve been a little less than a good<br /> example, and somehow I thought I was full of good advise at the same<br /> time. If I never lecture you about anything else, remember these two<br /> things: When you are faced with a choice, choose love, and without<br /> God, there is no love.

  To Love. May it be the light which<br /> guides you through your marriage, and through every aspect of your<br /> life. Congratulations to you both.
