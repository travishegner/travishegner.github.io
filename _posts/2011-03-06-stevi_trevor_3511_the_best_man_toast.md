Good evening,

You'll have to forgive me if I seem a bit nervous, I'm not used to being in a room where there are more people than computers.

Since this is a wedding and all, I decided that we should toast to love. By show of hands, how many of you believe in love? What is love? You can't see it, touch it, or hear it. It doesn't grow on a tree. Stevi is not going to call Trevor at work one day and say "Hey Hun, we are almost out of love, can you stop at the store and pick up a jar on your way home?"

Love is a hard thing to understand, and an even harder thing to try and describe. Even though you can't touch love, you can feel it. And even though you can't see love, you can see it's effect. Love is a simple smile, or a much needed hug. Love is a little note, or a few flowers. Love is a state of mind, a decision, and a choice.

Love is a proud young father, grinning from big ear, to big ear, as he carries around his newborn son. Love is a taco bell sauce packet, shipped across the country, and then saved for over a year because of it's special message. When your groom says "Why not?" when asked why he's marrying you, love is knowing that he was trying to say "Why wouldn't I?" Love is a big brother, trying to say something useful, and something meaningful, without sounding like a big sister.

>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.  
(1 Corinthians 13:4-8)

Trevor, I still remember vividly the first time you called me *Travis* instead of *Bruher*. Even though I practically forced you, it took me a long time to get used to it. I've learned since that moment that our relationship would be forever evolving. Over the years I've been a little less than a good example, and somehow I thought I was full of good advise at the same time. If I never lecture you about anything else, remember these two things: When you are faced with a choice, choose love, and without God, there is no love.

To Love. May it be the light which guides you through your marriage, and through every aspect of your life. Congratulations to you both.
