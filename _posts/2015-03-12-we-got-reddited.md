So, someone on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/firstworldanarchists/comments/2ys5r3/nsfw/" target="_blank">reddit</a> thought it would be rather funny to post a link to this image on our server at work:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-254" src="http://travishegner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/hardhatsmall.jpg" alt="hardhatsmall" width="300" height="200" />][1]

&nbsp;

It was posted under the heading &#8220;NSFW&#8221; (Not Safe For Work). If you aren&#8217;t aware, that typically denotes a post to something inappropriate in nature. It&#8217;s work safety gear, so it&#8217;s pretty funny. One of the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/firstworldanarchists/comments/2ys5r3/nsfw/cpcn224" target="_blank">comments</a> on the thread suggested that: &#8220;Their sysadmin is going to be very confused.&#8221; Indeed, we were:

The original image was rather large in nature, so we were moving a lot of outbound traffic (a lot for us anyway). So, to mitigate, I resized the image, and did an http 301redirect back to a custom (and very slim) html page:

We&#8217;ve never had that much traffic before, and we appreciate the opportunity to see what it&#8217;s like&#8230; even for a silly reason.
